# Space Shooter Game

## Overview
The Space Shooter Game is a simple console-based arcade game developed in C#. Players control a spaceship and must navigate through waves of enemy spacecraft while avoiding collisions. The goal is to survive for as long as possible and earn the highest score.

## Features
- **Player Control**: Players can move the spaceship horizontally and vertically using the arrow keys (← ↑ → ↓).
- **Enemy Waves**: Waves of enemy spacecraft spawn at random positions on the screen and move downward towards the player's spaceship.
- **Scoring**: Players earn points for each enemy spacecraft they destroy. The score increases as the player progresses through the game.
